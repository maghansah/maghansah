## 💡 How I Build Products

```python
def build_ai_product(vision, user_needs, technical_constraints):
    # 1. Strategic Discovery
    strategy = define_product_strategy(vision, market_analysis)
    
    # 2. Rapid Prototyping
    prototype = create_ai_prototype(strategy, user_needs)
    
    # 3. Data-Driven Validation
    validation = test_with_users(prototype, collect_metrics=True)
    
    # 4. Iterative Improvement
    while not product_market_fit(validation):
        prototype = iterate_based_on_data(prototype, validation)
        validation = test_with_users(prototype, collect_metrics=True)
    
    return scale_successful_product(prototype)
